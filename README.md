### personal imgui fork

This fork contains a number of incompatible changes to the original repository, the goal is to provide suggestions for alternative development and distribution methods.

- Source and headers separated into subdirectories
- `imgui_draw.cpp` renamed with `draw.cpp`
- External libraries moved to `/ext`
- Optional font assets removed
- Reference implementations from examples extracted into `/ref`
